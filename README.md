# reddit-bot
personal reddit up voting bot

This is the repository that will follow the tails of the datahoardingbot. A bot that lurks the vast subreddits looking for content to bring home. An experiment for me to learn with an around, to expand my knowledge and skills with python. At this current moment the bot can be a small section of tasks: upvote a subreddit recursively; upvote a user recursively; and pull content from r/wallpaper recursively.
